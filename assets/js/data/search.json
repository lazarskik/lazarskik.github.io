Their channel was used to post crypto scam videos. Password and 2FA protections were bypassed since the bad actor targeted session tokens stored within a web browser. Methods of preventing this attack will also be discussed.BackgroundLet’s start with a basic understanding of what a cookie is. It is a piece of data that is placed on your computer when you’re browsing the internet. These text files are automatically created by browsers and websites. Websites like Facebook or Amazon use a session cookie to store your login credentials. This provides you with a more seamless browsing experience since without it you would have to log into a site every time you reopened your web browser.The VulnerabilitySession Hijacking is a technique hackers use to steal session IDs to gain access to private systems and personal accounts without even having to enter in a username and password. Adversaries can send emails with attachments that on the surface seem harmless pdf files. However once a unsuspecting user clicks on the attachment a script runs in the background that grabs the session cookies from their web browser. All the adversary has to do is copy the values of the cookies from the victim’s computer onto their computer and gain access to the victim’s account.Video Explanation" }, { "title": "Telephone Basics", "url": "/posts/Telephone-Basics/", "categories": "Learning", "tags": "Phones", "date": "2023-03-19 14:17:00 -0500", "snippet": "IntroductionAfter watching the 1975 film Three Days of the Condor the other night, it was interesting to see the main character Joe Turner (played by Robert Redford) utilize a telephone test set to listen in on a phone call. You can see this in the picture below. After serving in the United States Army Signal Corps as a phone maintenance specialist, Turner graduated from the City College of New York before going onto Bell Labs and the CIA. He’s a computer geek who would not feel out of place in today’s Silicon Valley.Here’s an explanation of the tool being used. When connected to a line using the 2 leads, a test set is essentially indistinguishable from regular subscriber equipment. It can perform the following: monitor an active call, answer incoming calls, and make outgoing calls.The great thing about such movies is it makes you think about the skills needed in computer science, information technology and electrical engineering to troubleshoot issues and solve problems.Traditional Analog Phone LinesMany people believe telephone wiring is difficult to do by themselves. Actually, the way it works is rather simple if you’re familiar with the ways electrical signals work over copper wire. All you need is 2 pairs of wires - one is called the Tip and the other Ring which complete the telephone circuit. In terms of polarity, Tip (+) is the nickname for the electrically positive wire and Ring (-) is the nickname for the electrically negative wire. Tip is the Green wire and Ring is the Red wire in a 4 conductor wire seen in an RJ-11 cable.Modern Phone Systems (VoIP)Today our options to call someone in another state or even another country are easier and more affordable than ever before. SIP providers such as Voip.ms are a low cost alternative to paying for a traditional phone line. Also with software such as Zoiper supporting any VoIP service provider, you can receive calls to your number from anywhere in the world. It is a Unified VoIP communications solution which handles Audio, Video, Fax, Presence and Instant Messaging." }, { "title": "Affordable Technology", "url": "/posts/Affordable-Technology/", "categories": "Reviews", "tags": "technology, reviews", "date": "2023-03-19 13:59:00 -0500", "snippet": "IntroductionIn our modern world, there are so many options when it comes to computers and other electronic devices. As with anything in life, it is important to weigh the costs versus the benefits of a particular device. I strongly believe there are affordable and cheaper alternatives to mainstream products. If you take Apple products and now even Android phones from Samsung and Google they can cost upwards of $800 for decent specifications." }, { "title": "Electricity Basics", "url": "/posts/Electricity-Basics/", "categories": "Learning", "tags": "electricity", "date": "2023-03-18 14:42:00 -0500", "snippet": "IntroductionWe run so many electrical devices in our homes and offices but do we know what underlying concepts allow them to function? Let’s try to understand the basic building blocks of electricity and electronics first.The flow of electrical current through a wire is a flow of electrons.It is best to use a water analogy which is the flow of water through a pipe. The electrons are the water itself. Voltage is similar to water pressure. Potential difference is often referred to as voltage. It is noted V and measured in Volts. Think of this as the pressure that comes down from a water tower. Current is similar to flow rate. It is noted I and measured in Amps. In electrical terms, the current through the narrower pipe is less than the current through the wider pipe. Think of this as the diameter of the pipe. Resistance is the opposition to the passage of an electric current. Ohms noted as R is the unit of measure. You can think of it as sand in a pipe that slows down water flow.Power Power is measured in W (Watt) and it is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed at a given time. Think of a 60 Watt lightbulb or a 100 Watt audio amplifier. This is also know as the energy which is expended.MultiMeter Basics A multimeter is an important tool used to measure various electrical parameters such as voltage, current, resistance, and continuity." }, { "title": "Post from macOS", "url": "/posts/macOS-Post/", "categories": "Blogging, Tutorial", "tags": "", "date": "2022-05-14 11:27:00 -0500", "snippet": "PrerequisitesFollow the instructions in the Jekyll Docs to complete the installation of Ruby, RubyGems, Jekyll, and Bundler." }, { "title": "Getting Started", "url": "/posts/getting-started/", "categories": "Blogging, Tutorial", "tags": "getting started", "date": "2019-08-09 07:55:00 -0500", "snippet": "PrerequisitesFollow the instructions in the Jekyll Docs to complete the installation of Ruby, RubyGems, Jekyll, and Bundler.InstallationCreating a New SiteThere are two ways to create a new repository for this theme: Using the Chirpy Starter - Easy to upgrade, isolates irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing. Forking on GitHub - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to upgrade. Unless you are familiar with Jekyll and are determined to tweak or contribute to this project, this approach is not recommended.Option 1. Using the Chirpy StarterCreate a new repository from the Chirpy Starter and name it &amp;lt;GH_USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io, where GH_USERNAME represents your GitHub username.Option 2. Forking on GitHubFork Chirpy on GitHub and rename it to &amp;lt;GH_USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io. Please note that the default branch code is in development. If you want the site to be stable, please switch to the latest tag and start writing.And then execute:$ bash tools/init.sh Note: If you don’t want to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append option --no-gh at the end of the above command.The above command will: Removes some files or directories from your repository: .travis.yml files under _posts folder docs If the option --no-gh is provided, the directory .github will be deleted. Otherwise, set up the GitHub Action workflow by removing the extension .hook of .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml.hook, and then remove the other files and directories in the folder .github. Removes item Gemfile.lock from .gitignore. Creates a new commit to save the changes automatically.Installing DependenciesBefore running for the first time, go to the root directory of your site, and install dependencies as follows:$ bundleUsageConfigurationUpdate the variables of _config.yml as needed. Some of them are typical options: url avatar timezone langCustoming StylesheetIf you need to customize the stylesheet, copy the theme’s assets/css/style.scss to the same path on your Jekyll site, and then add the custom style at the end of the style file.Starting from v4.1.0, if you want to overwrite the SASS variables defined in _sass/addon/variables.scss, create a new file _sass/variables-hook.scss and assign new values to the target variable in it.Running Local ServerYou may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:$ bundle exec jekyll sOr run the site on Docker with the following command:$ docker run -it --rm \\ --volume=&quot;$PWD:/srv/jekyll&quot; \\ -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \\ jekyll serveAfter a while, the local service will be published at http://127.0.0.1:4000.DeploymentBefore the deployment begins, check out the file _config.yml and make sure the url is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the project site and don’t use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to change the baseurl to your project name that starts with a slash, e.g, /project-name.Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.Deploy by Using Github ActionsFor security reasons, GitHub Pages build runs on safe mode, which restricts us from using plugins to generate additional page files. Therefore, we can use GitHub Actions to build the site, store the built site files on a new branch, and use that branch as the source of the GitHub Pages service.Quickly check the files needed for GitHub Actions build: Ensure your Jekyll site has the file .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml. Otherwise, create a new one and fill in the contents of the sample file, and the value of the on.push.branches should be the same as your repo’s default branch name. Ensure your Jekyll site has file tools/deploy.sh. Otherwise, copy it from here to your Jekyll site. Furthermore, if you have committed Gemfile.lock to the repo, and your runtime system is not Linux, don’t forget to update the platform list in the lock file: $ bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux After the above steps, rename your repository to &amp;lt;GH_USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io on GitHub.Now publish your Jekyll site by: Push any commit to remote to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow. Once the build is complete and successful, a new remote branch named gh-pages will appear to store the built site files. Browse to your repository on GitHub. Select the tab Settings, then click Pages in the left navigation bar, and then in the section Source of GitHub Pages, select the /(root) directory of branch gh-pages as the publishing source. Remember to click Save before leaving. Visit your website at the address indicated by GitHub. Manually Build and DeployOn self-hosted servers, you cannot enjoy the convenience of GitHub Actions. Therefore, you should build the site on your local machine and then upload the site files to the server.Go to the root of the source project, and build your site as follows:$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bOr build the site on Docker:$ docker run -it --rm \\ --env JEKYLL_ENV=production \\ --volume=&quot;$PWD:/srv/jekyll&quot; \\ jekyll/jekyll \\ jekyll buildUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in folder _site of the project’s root directory. Now you should upload those files to the target server.UpgradingIt depends on how you use the theme: If you are using the theme gem (there will be gem &quot;jekyll-theme-chirpy&quot; in the Gemfile), editing the Gemfile and update the version number of the theme gem, for example: - gem &quot;jekyll-theme-chirpy&quot;, &quot;~&amp;gt; 3.2&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;= 3.2.1&quot;+ gem &quot;jekyll-theme-chirpy&quot;, &quot;~&amp;gt; 3.3&quot;, &quot;&amp;gt;= 3.3.0&quot; And then execute the following command: $ bundle update jekyll-theme-chirpy As the version upgrades, the critical files (for details, see the Startup Template) and configuration options will change. Please refer to the Upgrade Guide to keep your repo’s files in sync with the latest version of the theme. If you forked from the source project (there will be gemspec in the Gemfile of your site), then merge the latest upstream tags into your Jekyll site to complete the upgrade.The merge is likely to conflict with your local modifications. Please be patient and careful to resolve these conflicts. " } ]
