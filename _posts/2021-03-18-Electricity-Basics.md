### Introduction
We run so many electrical devices in our homes and offices but do we know what underlying concepts allow them to function? Let's try to understand the basic building blocks of electricity and electronics first.

The flow of electrical current through a wire is a flow of electrons.
It is best to use a water analogy which is the flow of water through a pipe. The electrons are the water itself.

- **Voltage** is similar to water pressure. Potential difference is often referred to as voltage. It is noted V and measured in Volts. Think of this as the pressure that comes down from a water tower.
- **Current** is similar to flow rate. It is noted I and measured in Amps. In electrical terms, the current through the narrower pipe is less than the current through the wider pipe. Think of this as the diameter of the pipe.
- **Resistance** is the opposition to the passage of an electric current. Ohms noted as R is the unit of measure. You can think of it as sand in a pipe that slows down water flow.

### Power
- **Power** is measured in W (Watt) and it is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed at a given time. Think of a 60 Watt lightbulb or a 100 Watt audio amplifier. This is also know as the energy which is expended.
